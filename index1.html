		<h1>SOME IMPORTANT TWEETS TO GO THROUGH</h1>
		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Myth #2: In summer, the virus will spread more due to mosquito bites. <br><br>Wrong. This infection is spread via respiratory droplets, not blood. Mosquitos don’t increase spread.</p>&mdash; Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FaheemYounus/status/1239705205538803712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Myth #4: Since COVID testing is unavailable, we should donate blood. The blood bank will test for it. <br><br>No blood bank is testing for Coronavirus so this attempt will fail. Blood donation is a sacred exercise; let’s make sure we are motivated by the right reasons.</p>&mdash; Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FaheemYounus/status/1239710918109466627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2020</a>

		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Myth #6: All this social distancing is an over reaction. You’ll see that the virus won’t cause much damage. <br><br>If we don’t see many infections (I hope) it actually will prove that social distancing worked. Not that the virus was never a big deal.</p>&mdash; Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FaheemYounus/status/1239710932059787265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Myth #8: Hand sanitizers are better than soap and water. <br><br>Wrong. Soap and water actually kills and washes away the virus from skin (it can not penetrate our skin cells) plus it also cleans visible soiling if hands. Don’t worry if Purrell was sold out at your supermarket.</p>&mdash; Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FaheemYounus/status/1239710939630448647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2020</a>

		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Myth #10: COVID-19 was deliberately spread by (depending upon your politics) the American or Chinese military. <br><br>Really???</p>&mdash; Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FaheemYounus/status/1239711726481952769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
